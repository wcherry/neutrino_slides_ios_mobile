# Everything either side shares — the scheme, the build, locating the .app — is

#   --physical        build for and run on a paired iOS device rather than a
#                     simulator. The device must be paired with this Mac,
#                     unlocked, and have Developer Mode enabled
#                     (Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode)
#   --device NAME     simulator to use (default: iPhone 17 Pro); with --physical,
#                     the device's name or UDID (default: the only one paired)
#   --os VERSION      runtime version, e.g. 18.0 (default: newest installed).
#                     Simulator only — a device runs the OS it runs
#   --release         build the Release configuration instead of Debug
#   --clean           clean the build directory first
#   --no-build        install and launch whatever was built last
#   --no-generate     skip xcodegen (use the .xcodeproj as it is on disk)
#   --reset           simulator: erase it before installing — wipes the Keychain
#                     and UserDefaults, so the app comes up at a signed-out first
#                     launch. This is the only way to retest login and key import.
#                     Device: uninstall the app, which takes its Keychain items
#                     and UserDefaults with it — the same signed-out first launch
#   --uninstall       remove the app first, keeping the rest of the device
#   --console         attach to the app's output and stay in the foreground
#   --screenshot[=P]  write a PNG after launch (default: build/screenshot.png).
